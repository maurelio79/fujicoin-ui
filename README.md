<b>Use this GUI at your own risk. I don't take any responsability.</b>
This gui is just an interface to fujicoind commands.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
Copy folder where you want, modify fujicoin-ui.conf according to your installation (basically you will need to change
just /home/maurelio/Web/git) and copy the file in .fujicoin folder <br>
<b>NOTE that if your fujicoin installation is not inside your home dir you need to change conf_file variable at the begining of the script!!!</b><br>

<h2>Implemented functions</h2>
Actually with this gui you can:
<ul>
<li>Start/Stop Fujicoind server</li>
<li>View general info about status (balance, blocks, difficulty, errors )</li>
<li>View transaction and filter them by account/category</li>
<li>Manage nodes (view/add/remove nodes)</li>
<li>Move coins from an account to another your account</li>
<li>Access fujicoind debug log</li>
</ul>

<b>Work in progress!!</b>
